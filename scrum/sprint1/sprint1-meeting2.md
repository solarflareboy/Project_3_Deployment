- William Harkins
- Arindam Gahlot
- Andrew Zehrer

### Meeting Agenda Items

- Discussed our individual progress, what we did yesterday, what we did that day.
- Discussed our main barrier.

### Status Update Since Last Meeting

Accomplishments:
- Christopher Colling - Working on client-server request system (mainly the client to the server), next steps will be individually revamping web pages to look super clean, and my main impediment is time, which this weekend will be my great chance to take advantage of that.
- Nicolas Garcia - Working on task 43 (Interacting with database), basically almost got it to work but needs more time to test. Will work on other functions that were in DBRequest
- Billy Harkins - Working on cashier screen functionality, specifically populating menu items from the database and updating the receipt when they are pressed.  Will work on implementing my completed functionality into the main project. My main impediment has been having to learn Javascript and EJS in order to implement functionality properly.
- Andrew - Working on manager view, the 4 main buttons need to open their own windows to see inventory, reports, etc. View Employees is on the backburner for now.
- Arindam - Working on the customer GUI that would be our starting homepage for our website also. In our homepage, the cashier and manager can login, as well as customers can order. The login screen is complete except for dynamically checking login from the database. The main barrier would be to press a button in one flex box and display an image in another flexbox.
