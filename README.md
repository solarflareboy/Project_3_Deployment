# Chick-fil-B

**Chick-fil-B** is a web-application bulit on [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) that is able to mimic a food ordering system from the perspectives of customers, cashiers, and managers. The design and products are inspired by the fast food chain [Chick-fil-A](https://www.chick-fil-a.com). This application is a project for the course **CSCE 315 - Programming Studio** at Texas A&M University.
